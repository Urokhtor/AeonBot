AeonBot - an user-friendly IRCbot library in the spirit of PircBot

AeonBot is multithreaded and abstracts the functionality of IRC under the EventHandler class
which contains all the callable events the user can handle.

It supports multiple networks natively.

At this stage everything else but ping out handler in Connection.py should be working correctly, so
if you don't ping out often running this bot should not be a problem!

IRCCommand is not a part of AeonBot, it's just the command interface I wrote for my bot that I'm
using. However anyone is free to use it if they want so I've included it alongside the AeonBot
library source.

More documentation will follow with examples how to run this bot.
